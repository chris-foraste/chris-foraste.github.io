projectsummary: "For the final project of my Simple Robotics class, my group and I created a web-integrated robotic game. I focused on both the mechanical and software aspects of the project. I first constructed a cable management system to ensure that the cables leading from the hub to the parts wouldn't get twisted as the robot rotated. I also coded the code for a satisfying swinging motion on the local side. Finally, I integrated the local behavior onto the web by using a combination of Javascript and MicroPython."
