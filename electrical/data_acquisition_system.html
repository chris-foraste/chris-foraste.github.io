projectsummary: "For my internship with Enstall, my main internship project was in upgrading a data acquisition system. Through websockets implementation, I reduced latency by 500%. I also implemented user-friendly upgrades to a TKinter GUI and redesigned an electronics casing to provide easier component access while also remaining intact upon unexpected falls. As this was a proprietary project, I unfortunately can't provide any specific details on this!"
skills: [TKinter, Websockets, Microcontrollers, 3D Design]
