projectsummary: "My final project for ME 40: Engineering Design I was to design a desktop to meet the unique needs of a teacher with cerebral palsy. From interview notes and recordings alongside physical measurements, we were able to design a specialized desktop providing high stability and easier access to paper. A modified version of our design was given to the teacher for long-term use at the end of the semester."
