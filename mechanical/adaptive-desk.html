projectsummary: "My final project for ME 40: Engineering Design I was to design a desktop to meet the unique needs of a teacher with cerebral palsy. From interview notes and recordings alongside physical measurements, we were able to design a specialized desktop providing high stability and easier access to paper. A modified version of our design was given to the teacher for long-term use at the end of the semester."

        <p>As I was the only person in my four person group with prior carpentry experience, I took a leading role on this project. The main difficulty the teacher had that we wanted to focus on was the difficulty in storing papers securely on his desk as it moved. He also loses stability the further he gets away from the desk, which would be necessary to access most conventional drawers. As such, to solve this problem, we created an opening in the top of the desk, which is easily accessible either from a standing or sitting position. Other smaller features were also added for additional convenience.</p>
