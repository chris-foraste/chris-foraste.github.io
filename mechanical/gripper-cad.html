projectsummary: "My final project for ES-19: Computer Aided Product Design was to take a large stack of SOLIDWORKS part drawings and then create the individual parts in SOLIDWORKS alongside the assembly, drawings (both part and assembly) as well as an animation showcasing the product's functionality. While all of the parts were pre-designed, this project still shows an impressive understanding of many of the more advanced features of SOLIDWORKS."
