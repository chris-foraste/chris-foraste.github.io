projectsummary: "This was my fourth project for my ME 30: Electronics and Controls I class. Using an Adafruit KB2040 (a low-level microcontroller similar to an Arduino Uno), custom-made PCBs, and some mechanical construction, I built an interactive table maze that can be controlled with joysticks for a fun and challenging experience.
