projectsummary: "As part of the Tufts Robotics Club, I am currently working on developing a boost converter that will power a raspberry pi and two 6V motors from a single 18650 battery. This is an intensive effort which is having me learn about numerous areas of electronics such as power electronics for the overall boost converter design, simulation techniques to recreate the motors, and analog filtering to reduce starting transient effects."
