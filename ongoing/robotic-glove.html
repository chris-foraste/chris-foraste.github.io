projectsummary: "For my EE 31: Junior Design Project class' go-beyond requirement, my group and I will be designing a wearable glove that will allow for remote control of a robot through the usage of hand movements. This will require designing the physical attachment to the hand alongside programming an ESP 32 to get precise IMU readings, send them via WebSockets, and then have our robot respond in an intuitive way."
