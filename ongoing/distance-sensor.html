projectsummary: "For my EE 31: Junior Design Project class, I was responsible for designing a custom distance sensor utilizing infrared LEDs and phototransistors to detect upcoming objects, thereby preventing collisions. I tightly calibrated it to black walls, but was able to switch it to sense white walls when the project requirements changed. As a result, the robot is able to successfully avoid collisions."
