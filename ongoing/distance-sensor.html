        <p>This sensor works by taking advantage of the non-linearity of the phototransistors to implement background subtraction. The robot has two copies of the same core sensing system implemented at different distances from the robot. This way, the one further out senses while the one further behind implements background subtraction. This ensures that the robot behaves appropriately regardless of orientation or light level. A moving average filter is implemented within the code to reduce noise.</p>
