      <h2>My Experience</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Academic Background</h3>
    <p>I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Tufts University, maintaining a 4.00 GPA and earning Dean’s List honors every semester. I was inducted into IEEE-HKN, the electrical engineering honors society, and have a strong foundation in controls, signal processing, instrumentation, and user-centered design. <br> <br> I was originally a mechanical engineering major during sophomore year, taking coursework in manufacturing methods, statics, dynamics, thermal systems, controls, CAD, and engineering design. Ultimately, I decided to transfer as of March 2025 in order to pursue electrical engineering fully.</p>

    <h3>Internship</h3>
    <p>This past summer, I interned with Enstall, a small solar racking company. Due to the smaller size of the company, I was able to take an interdisciplinary role, working across mechanical, electrical, and software domains. My main project for this internship was improving the speed and accuracy of an ESP-32 based data acquisition system. Through replacing the HTTP communication with Websockets and other code optimizations, the system became five times faster with improved accuracy. Utilizing my user-centered design experience, I was also able to improve the testing experience by implementing features such as automatic log file naming, individualized taring, and a prioritization feature that could turn the 5X speed increase into a 20X speed increase for a specific module.</p>

    <h3>Other Technical Roles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lego Robotics TA (Fall 2025):</strong><br>&emsp;  As a TA for the introductory lego robotics course, I am responsible for leading labs and office hours to help students work on projects utilizing the Lego SPIKE Prime platform. As many of the students have no prior robotics or coding experience, I have to use my scientific communication skills and break complicated concepts down into simple steps to ensure student success. I also work on various side-projects to support the course, such as utilizing wood-shop machinery to construct test rigs and testing new sensors before they are relased for student use.</li>
      <li><strong>CEEO Student Programmer (November 2023 - April 2024):</strong><br>&emsp; </li>
      <li><strong>Explorations Activity Head (Summer 2024):</strong><br>&emsp; </li>
    </ul>
